# Edge-Tab-Organizer

- Ever felt like it's too hard to go inside bookmarks section and load your favorite pages? We got it covered!
- Records page details as you browse.
- Anytime you find a group of pages you will need often, just click on the icon, add the pages to a category. (Still working on it, kinda done too)
- Now next time you start Edge, all you have to do is click the folder icon, and resume what you left. (Yep. Working on this too)
